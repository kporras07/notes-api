## Create Keys

In order to use JWT you need to create the certificates; to do this, you need to do as following:

- Make a new directory to hold the keys: `mkdir var/jwt`
- Create a private key (set a password that you'll use really soon): `openssl genrsa -out var/jwt/private.pem -aes256 4096`
- Create the public key: `openssl rsa -pubout -in var/jwt/private.pem -out var/jwt/public.pem`
- Edit .env (copy from .env.dist if it does not exist) and set the selected password for the variable JWT_PASSPHRASE

## Edit Environment variables

- Open .env and make changes as necessary

## Create Environment

To create this environment you need recent docker compose and docker versions and [ahoy](https://github.com/ahoy-cli/ahoy)
After installing that, you should run:

```
ahoy up
ahoy site install
npm run encore dev
chmod 777 -R var/cache/dev/easy_admin/
```

And voil√°! You can access your app at the url provided by `ahoy docker url`
